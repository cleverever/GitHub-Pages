# Hey, I'm Everett Craw
###### AKA:
- _Crawfish_
- _cleverever_
- _Mt. Everett_

I'm currently a second year at UCSD studying computer engineering. Aside from coding, I enjoy gaming, swimming, and hiking.

>There are 10 types of people in the world:<br />those who understand binary and those who don't.

## Goals
- [X] Graduate high school
- [ ] Survive college
- [ ] Work for Elon Musk

## Language and Style
My favorite programming languages are
1. Java
2. C++
3. ARM Assembly

I typically like to write bracketed statements like this
```
void foo()
{
    //do something
}
```
as opposed to
```
void foo() {
    //do something
}
```
because it improves the code readability for me. The opening and closing brackets line up very cleanly when the opening bracket is on a new line.
